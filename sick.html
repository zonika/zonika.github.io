<h1>My Week(s) of Rest and Relaxation</h1>
<h2>Or, how I've survived a mild case of COVID-19</h2>

<p style="color: red">Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. I wrote this post to share my experience because most of what I've read online has been about death tolls and ventilator shortages. This is a first hand account and should not be taken as medical advice.</p>

<p>As of tonight (Sunday April 5, 2020) I have been sick for 13 days. I have a generally strong immune system and have never been sick for this long, in fact I've never even had the flu. I started experiencing a dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever on March 23rd and have been in isolation since then, assuming that I have COVID-19. I have not been tested as I live in New York City, the current epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, and tests are not available to people without severe (hospitalization-worthy) symptoms. My doctor's advice was to assume that what I have is COVID-19 and treat my symptoms accordingly.</p>

<p>My symptoms so far have been fever, dry cough, shortness of breath/chest tightness, body aches, intense fatigue, and headaches. I also have a "reactive airway" which means I experience asthma symptoms when I get sick or do intense physical activity, like sprinting. My reactive airway caused my respiratory symptoms (mainly shortness of breath and feeling of tightness in the chest) to become more severe than what's expected for mild COVID-19 cases. I made sure to have an albuterol inhaler as well as nebulizer vials on hand, and found that regular nebulizer treatments (2-4 times per day depending on how severe the symptoms were) helped temporarily take the edge off my respiratory issues.</p>

<p>Other things that have helped include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using a humidifier 24/7: I have been filling it with filtered water and cleaning it every few days with white vinegar to prevent further infection from a dirty humidifier.</li>
  <li>Drinking lots of water. I've also heard that Pedialyte is recommended, but I don't like the taste so have just been sticking to water</li>
  <li>Albuterol inhaler/nebulizer vials (2-4x daily for those with asthma)</li>
  <li>Pulse Oximeter: This was more of a "nice to have" and helped with my anxiety more than anything else. When I felt like I truly couldn't breathe, checking my blood oxygen saturation percentage to confirm that it was normal (normal is between 95 and 100%) helped quell my anxiety</li>
  <li>Hot showers temporarily help with the shortness of breath and body aches</li>
  <li>Bland food: I haven't really had an apetite, so I've been eating a lot of matzo and avocado to make sure my body gets some nutrients</li>
</ul>

<p>My doctor advised against taking Advil, and I didn't find that taking Tylenol helped at all. Last week I was perscribed the anti-viral drug Hydroxychloroquine, which you may have read about in the news, but was not able to find a pharmacy in the city that has it in stock. I also felt wary of taking a drug designed to treat Malaria. Hydroxychloroquine has not been proven as a viable treatment for COVID-19.</p>

<p>I cannot stress the importance of rest enough in this process. I've had a few days where I felt normal enough to talk on the phone for an hour and afterwards lost my breath completely. I'm now making sure to keep my talking and exercise to a minimum to allow my lungs to fully recover from the infection.</p>

<p>I have been isolated in my apartment for 13 days, and have been advised to stay in isolation until I have gone 72 hours with no symptoms and without any medication to treat my symptoms or seven days after symptoms started, whichever comes later (the latter does not apply for me as I've had symptoms for 13 days).</p>

<p>I am incredibly grateful for the support I've gotten from family and friends in the past two weeks. I'm extremely lucky to have a mom who lives in the city and has a car and adequite PPE and has been able to deliver me what I need when I can't find another service to deliver it. I'm extremely lucky to work at a job with a forgiving sick leave policy and a safe, comfortable home to isolate in. I'm grateful to have the resources to order in food and groceries when I need them, and enough money to generously tip the people delivering them. Gig economy workers have historically been given the short end of the stick in terms of compensation and workers rights and are putting their lives on the line to feed their families. If you're using a delivery service and can afford it, please thank the courier by giving them more money.</p>

<p>I hope that reading this was helpful for someone, and will do my best to <a href="mailto:zchodosh@gmail.com">answer questions</a> about my experience if they come up. My only other ask, especially for those living in NYC, is that people assume that they've already been exposed to COVID-19. If you don't have symptoms, please keep your neighbors in mind and minimize leaving your house as much as possible. When you feel the need to leave your apartment for a "sanity stroll," consider the elderly lady that lives down the hall, and if your walk is worth making her sick.</p>

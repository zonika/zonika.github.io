    <h2>Some recent projects...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3><a href="http://nymag.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>New York</em> Magazine</a> Homepage:</h3> Created a brand new NYMag Homepage, previously one of the oldest pages in NYMag's codebase, using the Clay CMS. Project included building Clay components for sections and article slots as well as integration with an existing microservice that programmatically populates article slots based on an Elasticsearch query provided by each slot. <a href="http://nymag.com/press/2018/11/new-york-magazine-launches-new-home-page-design.html">Read more about it here!</a></li>

Project included re-skinning in-article components, brand new recirculation components, a persistant right rail, and four new article page lede designs, as well as working with writers and editors to establish standards for building articles that make production more streamlined.</li>
      <li><h3>Apple News:</h3> Built brand new, component-based Apple News Format templates that render seamlessly from Clay component data, as well as the microservice that composes the templates and programmatically publishes them to Apple News upon article publish.</li>
      <li><h3><a href="https://www.thecut.com">The Cut</a> Redesign:</h3> Created a new homepage for the Cut, built using the Clay CMS and the homepage microservice mentioned above.

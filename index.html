    <h2>A Delicious Sampling of Recent Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>New York Magazine Apple News Templates</em> Built an open-source <a href="http://github.com/clay/amphora-apple-news">Apple News Format renderer</a> for <a href="http://github.com/clay">Clay</a> components, redesigned article templates, and built a microservice to automatically publish Clay articles to Apple News for all four NYMag Apple News Channels.</li>
      <li><em>The Cut Image Galleries</em> Built a scrolling gallery UI for photo-driven articles on The Cut that would previously appear as slideshows. Gallery includes two view options (list and grid) and dynamic ad placement for enhanced photo viewability. <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/the-best-street-style-from-new-york-fashion-week-fall-2018.html">Here</a> is an example of the template in action.</li>
